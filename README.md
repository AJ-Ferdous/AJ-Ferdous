### About Me
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="17px"/> Hi, I'm Ahmed Jubaer Ferdous, a current 3rd year Computer Science student at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) 📍 Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

📕 I'm an avid reader. I like non-fiction,  mostly - productivity, business, finance and self-help books. Besides that, I occasionally enjoy diving into history books as well. 

🏋️‍♂️ My athletic interest include hitting the gym regularly.

⚽ I'm a huge soccer(football) fan, especially of the Spanish club FC Barcelona. I've been a loyal fan since 2013.

### Interests
📈 I'm interested in Data Science and Analytics and take great joy in looking at data to find patterns and tendencies.

❌ I don't jump to conclusions. Unlike a lot of people, a simple correlation does not always imply causation to me. 😉

➕ I'm trying to enter the world of web dev too. I'm fluent in HTML and Javascript and now on my journey to learn a framework.
